# Nonlinear Control Sytems Laboratory Exercises

Course: [Nonlinear Control Systems](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/ncs_d)

Results for each laboratory exercise can be found in `n.lab/labn_enio_krizman_jmbag.pdf` files and codes in `n.lab/Matlab` folders.

## 1. Trajectories of non-linear states system

Goal of this exercise is to observe the appearance of deterministic chaos in the dynamic behavior of nonlinear systems. Notice the dependence of the qualitative dynamic behavior of the nonlinear system on the initial conditions. Familiarize yourself with phase portraits of nonlinear control systems.

* Chuas circuit
* Calculation of the phase trajectory of the system with a two-position relay with hysteresis and second-order dynamics
* Simulation of the phase trajectory of the system with a two-position relay with hysteresis and second-order dynamics

## 2. Descriptive function and self-oscillations

Goal of this exercise is to observe the appearance of self-oscillations in the dynamic behavior of nonlinear systems. Familiarize yourself with the concept of the describing function and its application in the analysis of self-oscillations in nonlinear systems.

* Experimental determination of the describing function of a nonlinear system
* Analysis of the self-oscillations of a nonlinear system 

## 3. Forced oscillations

The goal of this exercise is to observe the appearance of forced oscillations in the dynamic behavior of nonlinear systems and Dihter's signal application for system linearization of closed-loop systems. 

* Graphical analysis of the forced oscillations of a nonlinear system
* Linearization of closed-loop systems using the Dihter's signal

## 4. Linearization in feedback loops

The goal of this exercise is to observe different methods of linearization - the method of tangent linearization and the method of linearization in feedback loops.

* Linearization of a nonlinear system using the method of tangent linearization
* Linearization of a nonlinear system in feedback loops
